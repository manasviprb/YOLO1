# YOLO1
Basic implementation of the YOLO algorithm for object identification

YOLO is an algorithm that uses neural networks to provide real-time object detection. This algorithm is popular because of its speed and accuracy. It has been used in various applications to detect traffic signals, people, parking meters, and animals. The “You Only Look Once,” or YOLO, family of models are a series of end-to-end deep learning models designed for fast object detection. The approach involves a single deep convolutional neural network (originally a version of GoogLeNet, later updated and called DarkNet based on VGG) that splits the input into a grid of cells and each cell directly predicts a bounding box and object classification. The result is a large number of candidate bounding boxes that are consolidated into a final prediction by a post-processing step.
